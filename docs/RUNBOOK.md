### 1. Prerequisites

```
- AWS account
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed
- SSH access to EC2
- Docker & Docker Compose (installed via Ansible)
```

---

### 2. Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Outcome:**

- EC2 instance created
- Security group allows: 22, 8080, 5000

---

### 3. Host Configuration (Ansible)

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini bootstrap.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

**What this does:**

- Installs Docker
- Installs Docker Compose
- Prepares host for containers

This runs the ansible role roles/docker which:

- adds Docker’s official apt repo + GPG key
- installs docker-ce + docker-compose-plugin
- starts/enables docker service
- adds SSH user to docker group (requires re-login)

Verify:

- docker --version
- docker compose version

---

### 4. Application Deployment (Docker Compose)

From EC2:

```
cd docker/
docker-compose up -d
```

**Outcome:**

- Frontend container running
- API container running
- Database container running

#### The frontend Nginx container also serves as a reverse proxy, forwarding API requests internally to keep backend services private.
---

### 5. Verification

From browser:

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
Frontend shows API status: ok
```

Expected:

- Frontend loads
- Frontend can reach API
- API can reach database

---

### 6. Shutdown (optional)

```
docker-compose down
```

---

## Execution Order

```
terraform apply
      ↓
ansible-playbook
      ↓
docker-compose up
      ↓
browser verification
```
